OgrePCZFrustum.h  -  PCZ Supplemental Culling Frustum

This isn't really a traditional "frustum", but more a collection of
extra culling planes used by the PCZ Scene Manager for supplementing
the camera culling and light zone culling by creating extra culling
planes from visible portals.  Since portals are 4 sided, the extra 
culling planes tend to form frustums (pyramids) but nothing in the 
code really assumes that the culling planes are frustums.  They are
just treated as planes.  

The "originPlane" is a culling plane which passes through the origin
point specified.  It is used to cull portals which are close to, but
behind the camera view.  (the nature of the culling routine doesn't
give correct results if you just use the "near" plane of the standard
camera frustum (unless that near plane distance is 0.0, but that is
highly not recommended for other reasons having to do with having a 
legal view frustum).
