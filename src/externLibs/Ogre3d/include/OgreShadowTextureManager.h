		across many scene manager instances. Where multiple scene managers are
		used with shadow textures, the configuration of those shadows may or may

        Why do we do this? Well, it's because the Singleton
        implementation is in a .h file, which means it gets compiled
        into anybody who includes it. This is needed for the
        Singleton template to work, but we actually only want it
        compiled into the implementation of the class based on the
        Singleton, not all of them. If we don't change this, we get
        link errors when trying to use the Singleton-based class from
        an outside dll.
        @par
        This method just delegates to the template version anyway,
        but the implementation stays in this single compilation unit,
        preventing link errors.
