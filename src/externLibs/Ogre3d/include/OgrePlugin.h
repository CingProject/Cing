	/** Class defining a generic OGRE plugin.
	@remarks
		OGRE is very plugin-oriented and you can customise much of its behaviour
		by registering new plugins, dynamically if you are using dynamic linking.
		This class abstracts the generic interface that all plugins must support.
		Within the implementations of this interface, the plugin must call other
		OGRE classes in order to register the detailed customisations it is
		providing, e.g. registering a new SceneManagerFactory, a new
		MovableObjectFactory, or a new RenderSystem.
	@par
		Plugins can be linked statically or dynamically. If they are linked
		dynamically (ie the plugin is in a DLL or Shared Object file), then you
		load the plugin by calling the Root::loadPlugin method (or some other
		mechanism which leads to that call, e.g. plugins.cfg), passing the name of
		the DLL. OGRE will then call a global init function on that DLL, and it
		will be expected to register one or more Plugin implementations using
		Root::installPlugin. The procedure is very similar if you use a static
		linked plugin, except that you simply instantiate the Plugin implementation
		yourself and pass it to Root::installPlugin.
	@note
		Lifecycle of a Plugin instance is very important. The Plugin instance must
		remain valid until the Plugin is uninstalled. Here are the things you
		must bear in  mind:
		<ul><li>If your plugin is in a DLL:
		<ul><li>Create the Plugin instance and call Root::installPlugin in dllStartPlugin</li>
		<li>Call Root::uninstallPlugin, then delete it in dllStopPlugin</li></ul>
		<li>If your plugin is statically linked in your app:
		<ul><li>Create the Plugin anytime you like</li>
		<li>Call Root::installPlugin any time whilst Root is valid</li>
		<li>Call Root::uninstallPlugin if you like so long as Root is valid. However,
			it will be done for you when Root is destroyed, so the Plugin instance must
			still be valid at that point if you haven't manually uninstalled it.</li></ul>
		</ul>
		The install and unninstall methods will be called when the plugin is
		installed or uninstalled. The initialise and shutdown will be called when
		there is a system initialisation or shutdown, e.g. when Root::initialise 
		or Root::shutdown are called.
