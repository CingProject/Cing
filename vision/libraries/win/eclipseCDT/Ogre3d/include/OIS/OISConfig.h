/** 
@remarks
	These lines have no bearing on internal build of OIS. This is here for
	external build settings. Meaning, changing this does not require a
	rebuild of OIS. This just affects VC dll import settings, as the DLL
	build already defines this during its build for setting dll exports.
	The undefine here is here just incase you decide to only use
	DLL, and want to set it permently and recompile OIS too.. Avoid redefinition
	from DLL build of OIS.

	So, if wanting to link against DLL version, just uncomment these lines.
