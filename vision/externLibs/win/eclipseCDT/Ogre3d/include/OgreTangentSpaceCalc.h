		@param targetSemantic The semantic to store the tangents in. Defaults to

        @param sourceTexCoordSet The texture coordinate index which should be used as the source
            of 2D texture coordinates, with which to calculate the tangents.
        @param index The element index, ie the texture coordinate set which should be used to store the 3D
            coordinates representing a tangent vector per vertex, if targetSemantic is 
			VES_TEXTURE_COORDINATES. If this already exists, it will be overwritten.
		@returns
			A structure containing the results of the tangent space build. Vertex data
			will always be modified but it's also possible that the index data
			could be adjusted. This happens when mirroring is used on a mesh, which
			causes the tangent space to be inverted on opposite sides of an edge.
			This is discontinuous, therefore the vertices have to be split along
			this edge, resulting in new vertices.
