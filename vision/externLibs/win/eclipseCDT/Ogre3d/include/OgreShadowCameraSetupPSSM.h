		A PSSM shadow system uses multiple shadow maps per light and maps each
		texture into a region of space, progressing away from the camera. As such
		it is most appropriate for directional light setups. This particular version
		also uses LiSPSM projection for each split to maximise the quality. 
	@note
		Because PSSM uses multiple shadow maps per light, you will need to increase
		the number of shadow textures available (via SceneManager) to match the 
		number of shadow maps required (default is 3 per light).
