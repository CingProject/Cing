*\section INTRO INTRODUCTION
<p>
<b>GIMPACT</b> is a software library with tools for geometry processing and collision detection, focused on solving most common problems on Virtual Reality development.
</p>
<p>
Since Version 0.2, <b>GIMPACT</b> will work integrated with the <b>Bullet Engine</b> for general collision detection and physics. For  more details, please visit http://www.continuousphysics.com/Bullet/
</p>
<p>For updates, please visit http://sourceforge.net/projects/gimpact/ </p>

/*! \page FEATURES
- C++ oriented.
- Extensible design.
- Collision detection algorithm for concave shapes in the <b>Bullet Physics Engine</b>. See btGImpactCollisionAlgorithm.
- Efficient Dynamic <b>Hierarcht Bounding Box tree structures</b> for handle collisions with composed shapes whose have large sets of primitives (triangles or convex shapes) See the GIM_BOX_TREE_SET class.
- Collision detection for trimeshes with the btGImpactMeshShape class. Now <b>GIMPACT</b> works fine with the btStridingInterface class for getting the data from trimesh models.
- Support for deformable trimeshes.
- Collision detection for compound shapes through the btGImpactCompoundShape class. This class takes advantage from the Hierarcht Bounding Box structure (GIM_BOX_TREE_SET class).
- Collision Shapes (Both btGImpactCompoundSape and btGImpactTrimeshShape ) can be shared by two or more Rigid Bodies in <b>Bullet</b>.

This guide will show how to incorpore the GIMPACt functionality on the Bullet Engine:
*\section REG Registering the Algorithm
For register this algorithm in Bullet, proceed as following:
 \code
btCollisionDispatcher * dispatcher = static_cast<btCollisionDispatcher *>(m_dynamicsWorld ->getDispatcher());
btGImpactCollisionAlgorithm::registerAlgorithm(dispatcher);
 \endcode
</p>
With the instructon above, btGImpactCollisionAlgorithm will handle:
- Convex shapes vs GImpact shapes.
- Concave shapes vs GImpact shapes.
- Compoind shapes vs GImpact shapes.

*\section CREATING_SHAPES Creating Shapes.
*\subsection TRIMESH Creating trimeshes.
<p>For creating trimeshes you must provide an interface for your model data. You could use btTriangleIndexVertexArray class for providing the indices and the vertices from your triangle models.</p>
<p>
For example, you could create a trimesh from memory as following:
\code
btTriangleIndexVertexArray* indexVertexArrays = new btTriangleIndexVertexArray(NUM_TRIANGLES,
		&gIndices[0][0],
		3*sizeof(int),
		NUM_VERTICES,(REAL*) &gVertices[0],sizeof(REAL)*3);
\endcode
</p>
<p>
Where gIndices is an array of integers and gVertices is an array of float with 3 components.
</p>
Then you must create the Trimesh shape as following:
\code
btGImpactMeshShape * trimesh = new btGImpactMeshShape(indexVertexArrays);
\endcode
The next step is configuring the trimesh, for example changing the scale:
\code
trimesh->setLocalScaling(btVector3(4.f,4.f,4.f));
\endcode
At end, you must call btGImpactMeshShape.updateBound for ensure that the shape will build its internal Box set structure:
\code
trimesh->updateBound();// Call this method once before doing collisions
\endcode
Also you must call btGImpactMeshShape.postUpdate() each time when changing the trimesh data ( For deformable meshes), this will enable a flag to the trimesh shape which tells that the trimesh data has been changed and btGImpactMeshShape.updateBound will be called in collision routines.
<

*\subsection COMPOUND Compound Shapes.
For compound shapes, you must create btGImpactCompoundShape objects. Then you could add
sub shapes as following;
\code
btGImpactCompoundShape * mycompound = new btGImpactCompoundShape();

btTransform localtransform;
 .... Setting transformation

//add shapes with transformation
btCollisionShape * subshape = creatingShape(0);
mycompound->addChildShape(localtransform,subshape);
.... Setting transformation
btCollisionShape * subshape2 = creatingShape(1);
mycompound->addChildShape(localtransform,subshape);
.... add more shapes
\endcode
At end, you must call btGImpactCompoundShape.updateBound for ensure that the shape will build its internal Box set structure:
