	/** This class is used to perform Resource operations in a
		background thread. 
	@remarks
		If threading is enabled, Ogre will create a single background thread
		which can be used to load / unload resources in parallel. Only one
		resource will be processed at once in this background thread, but it
		will be in parallel with the main thread. 
	@par
		The general approach here is that on requesting a background resource
		process, your request is placed on a queue ready for the background
		thread to be picked up, and you will get a 'ticket' back, identifying
		the request. Your call will then return and your thread can
		proceed, knowing that at some point in the background the operation wil 
		be performed. In it's own thread, the resource operation will be 
		performed, and once finished the ticket will be marked as complete. 
		You can check the status of tickets by calling isProcessComplete() 
		from your queueing thread. It is also possible to get immediate 
		callbacks on completion, but these callbacks happen in the background 
		loading thread (not your calling thread), so should only be used if you
		really understand multithreading. 
	@par
		By default, when threading is enabled this class will start its own 
		separate thread to perform the actual loading. However, if you would 
		prefer to use your own existing thread to perform the background load,
		then be sure to call setStartBackgroundThread(false) before initialise() is
		called by Root::initialise. Your own thread should call _initThread
		immediately on startup, before any resources are loaded at all, and
		_doNextQueuedBackgroundProcess to process background requests.
	@note
		This class will only perform tasks in a background thread if 
		OGRE_THREAD_SUPPORT is defined to be 1. Otherwise, all methods will
		call their exact equivalents in ResourceGroupManager synchronously.
