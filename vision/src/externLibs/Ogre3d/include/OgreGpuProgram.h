        Gpu program state includes constant parameters used by the program, and
        bindings to render system state which is propagated into the constants 
        by the engine automatically if requested.
    @par
        GpuProgramParameters objects should be created through the GpuProgram and
        may be shared between multiple Pass instances. For this reason they
        are managed using a shared pointer, which will ensure they are automatically
        deleted when no Pass is using them anymore. 
	@par
		High-level programs use named parameters (uniforms), low-level programs 
		use indexed constants. This class supports both, but you can tell whether 
		named constants are supported by calling hasNamedParameters(). There are
		references in the documentation below to 'logical' and 'physical' indexes;
		logical indexes are the indexes used by low-level programs and represent 
		indexes into an array of float4's, some of which may be settable, some of
		which may be predefined constants in the program. We only store those
		constants which have actually been set, therefore our buffer could have 
		gaps if we used the logical indexes in our own buffers. So instead we map
		these logical indexes to physical indexes in our buffer. When using 
		high-level programs, logical indexes don't necessarily exist, although they
		might if the high-level program has a direct, exposed mapping from parameter
		names to logical indexes. In addition, high-level languages may or may not pack
		arrays of elements that are smaller than float4 (e.g. float2/vec2) contiguously.
		This kind of information is held in the ConstantDefinition structure which 
		is only populated for high-level programs. You don't have to worry about
		any of this unless you intend to read parameters back from this structure
		rather than just setting them.
